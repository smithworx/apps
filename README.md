# Apps

This repository contains lightweight apps, each in its own folder.

## Structure

- One app per top-level directory
- Each app manages its own code, dependencies, and run instructions

## Current apps

- `countdown`

## Deployment

Deployed apps are available at:

- `https://smithworx.github.io/apps/{app_name}`

Example:

- `https://smithworx.github.io/apps/countdown`

## Adding a new app

1. Create a new folder at the repo root (for example, `my-app`).
2. Add the app code and any app-specific config files inside that folder.
3. Include a `README.md` in the app folder with setup and run steps.

## Suggested app folder layout

```text
my-app/
  README.md
  src/
  package.json (if needed)
```
